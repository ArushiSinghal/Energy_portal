<p>Our methodology is in no way a perfect science, but we made educated approximations while still preserving a user friendly interface. We ultimately wanted the calculator to be easy, quick, and informative. The calculations capture a day in the life as well as a year in the life of a student. We wanted to capture what makes your life as a student unique, like night partying, textbook purchases, and a fourth mealafter a long night of studying. We will go through each tab and explain the basics that went into each calculation. Not all of the questions factor into the calculations; but some questions are there for the sake of getting people to think about their lifestyles. We also base some of the calculations on the idea of a “weighted population.”  This assumes students living on campus will use more water, energy, and waste, while part time or commuter students consume less of those resources.</p>

				<h2>CONVERSION FOR Transportation CAR</h2>
<p>For ease of use we decided to categorize cars as small,average, SUV/truck, and hybrid. This way the user did not have to research their exact fuel efficiency. The user only had to approximate the number of miles driven in a give n month.This same tactic was used for bus travel and train travel.  The conversion for air travel is a little more complex in that we use the amount of CO2e /passengerkilometer and also multiply by a factor of 1.09 to account for the uplift factor. The uplift factor is taking into consideration non direct flights, delays, andcircling.</p>

					<h2>WATER</h2>
<p>This water usage includes the water used for irrigation, fountains around campus, bathrooms, etc. In order to avoid double counting we subtracted out the average amount of water a full time student uses multiplied by the number of students living on campus. We then divided that total by the number of undergrad, grad, faculty, and staff that use the campus on a day to day basis. Then we multiplied by the appropriate weight given the status of the user. We then proceeded to calculate water from shower usage, toilet flushes, laundry, and hydration. We researched the kg CO2e it takes to filter and transport a gallon of water. After that we just had to look up how many gallons are used in one flush, how many gallons are used per minute of showering, how many gallons used per load of load of laundry.Then it was just a matter of multiplying the user responses to get the total gallons of water used times the carbon it takes per gallon.</p>
